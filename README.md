## 📊 Visualizations & Insights

### 1. Top 10 Countries by Confirmed Cases
- Countries like USA, Brazil, India are the most affected.
- High confirmed cases often indicate higher healthcare burden.

### 2. Death Distribution (Top 5 Countries)
- A few countries account for 60%+ of global deaths.
- Death rate disparities reveal healthcare system differences.

### 3. Heatmap of Correlation
- `Confirmed` highly correlates with `Deaths` and `Recovered`.
- `Deaths / 100 Cases` inversely relates to `Recovered / 100 Cases`.

### 4. Mortality Rate vs Confirmed Cases (Scatter)
- Some countries with moderate cases have high mortality.
- WHO regions vary in severity and health outcomes.

### 5. Weekly % Increase by WHO Region
- Outbreaks still growing in some regions (AFRO, SEARO).
- Box plots help highlight spread trends.
